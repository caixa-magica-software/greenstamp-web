## Instructions

If you don't have NodeJS installed, download it from either https://nodejs.org/en/download or your package manager.<br/>
Make sure to install the optional python dependencies for NodeJS, as these are needed to install some of the packages you will need.<br/>
Afterwards, clone this project and then install dependencies and start the frontend by running the following commands inside the 'web' folder:
<br/><br/>
`npm i` installs all dependencies<br/>
`npm start` starts the development server and opens the webpage in your browser<br/>
