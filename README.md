## Instructions

If you don't have **NodeJS** installed, download it from either https://nodejs.org/en/download or your package manager.<br/>
Make sure to install the **optional dependencies** for NodeJS, as these are needed to install some of the packages this application uses.<br/>
Afterwards, clone this repository and run the following commands inside the 'web' folder:
<br/><br/>
`npm i` installs all dependencies<br/>
`npm start` starts the development server and opens the webpage in your browser<br/>

Make sure you also change the URIs in **'src/config/Api.js'** to match your backend's address.
